Several components are available for BDI implementations.

## [FIWARE iSHARE Satellite](https://github.com/FIWARE/ishare-satellite)

A simple implementation of an iSHARE satellite trust anchor.

It is based on Python Flask using gunicorn and runs completely stateless. It is configured with a static configuration file.

_This implementation of the iSHARE Satellite is only meant for testing and demonstration purposes. It is not possible to change participants or trusted CAs in a running instance. It is not recommended to be used in production environments._

## [Poort8 Dataspace Noodle Bar](https://github.com/POORT8/Poort8.Dataspace.NoodleBar)Poort8 Noodlebar

The project is under the Basis Data Infrastructuur (BDI) umbrella, pending its ongoing development.

To facilitate setting up dataspaces that follow certain principles, serving as an initial platform for data providers, apps, and data consumers.
Roles

 - Data Providers: Organizations that either offer a data source with raw data or an app with processed data. In all cases, access conditions are set by the data owner.
 - App Providers: Organizations that act as intermediaries, adding value to raw data. They act as a Data Consumer on behalf of their end users, and as a Data Provider for their end users.
 - Data Consumers: Organizations that use data via Service Providers or directly.
 - Dataspace initiators: Organizations that setup and manage the dataspace.

## [iSHARE .Net Client](https://github.com/iSHAREScheme/iSHARE.NET)

This is official iSHARE library which provides core functionality for service consumers. In other words, it encapsulates HTTP request calls towards iSHARE endpoints, JWT response validation and mapping business logic.

## [iSHARE Authorization Registry](https://github.com/iSHAREScheme/AuthorizationRegistry)

_The Authorization Registry-code that is in this repository is not a 'production-ready' Authorization Registry, meaning it has a limited set of functionalities. It can be used in proof of concepts or pilots to showcase the iSHARE Authorization protocol, however many functionalities can be improved. Furthermore, it should be noted that only the request and return made to the /delegation endpoint (as described on our Developer Portal) is specified within the iSHARE standards. How an authorization registry registers policies and translates these into delegation evidence is up to the authorization registry. This code only provides one of the options to do so._

## [iSHARE Satellite](https://github.com/iSHAREScheme/iSHARESatellite)

This is the iSHARE equivalant of a BDI Assocation Register.

The iSHARE satellite is an application that safeguards trust in a dataspace. It functions as a register of participants. Participants can call the satellite API to verify each other. When you verify that a participant is registered in the satellite, you know that this participant has signed which agreements and the participant is indeed a part of a dataspace, also on a "legal level".
