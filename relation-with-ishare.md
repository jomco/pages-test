Basic Data Infrastructure (BDI) and iSHARE are closely related in their goal to enhance data sharing within the logistics and supply chain sectors. BDI aims to streamline and secure the exchange of information among various stakeholders by standardizing data-sharing practices and incorporating automated processes. To achieve this, BDI leverages the iSHARE Trust Framework as its foundational layer. iSHARE provides a robust system for managing digital identities and access control, ensuring that only authorized parties can access specific data. This integration allows BDI to establish a high level of trust and security in its operations, enabling efficient and reliable data exchanges.

The iSHARE Trust Framework complements BDI by offering a comprehensive set of agreements and protocols that govern how data is shared and accessed. By building upon iSHARE, BDI not only benefits from enhanced identity verification and access management but also ensures interoperability with other data space initiatives like IDSA and GAIA-X. This interoperability is crucial for creating a seamless and unified digital infrastructure across different platforms and organizations. Consequently, the collaboration between BDI and iSHARE fosters a secure, transparent, and efficient data-sharing environment that instills confidence among all stakeholders in the logistics and supply chain industry.
